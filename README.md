add a file browser to the installable applications menu.

actually change the games directory for unleash and the dvd2xbox app so it has a use and I'm not screwing around in the file menu... WHICH IS NOT A APP TO INSTALL!!! 

(maybe one day someone will write a useful dashboard that combines all the needed functions... until then unleash or evox to save my poor dying laser and I can play my moded halo 2 maps.)

add a X2CONFIG.INI so I dont have to deal with more screwing around... "hardmoded" yeah no shit. it was the only way to get this piece of dying trash to function again.... I still need the softmod to do the real work... why do you disable me... If I wanted a handicap I would just run stock... which dosnt work anyway.
maybe add the ability to change the x2config.ini to reflect two dashboards.... then two recoveries...
